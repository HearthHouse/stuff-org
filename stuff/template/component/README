Package-SVGs have been derived from the SVG components found
in this project:

http://www.sebulli.com/BlackBoard/Blackboard_incl_SVG_14Nov2012.zip

Name the file so that it matches the canonicalized package name, with "package-"
prefix and ".svg" suffix (e.g. "package-DIP-16.svg").

For DIP-packages, the size to 200x160 (easiest: manually in the <svg> header).
Center the component in that area (easiest: with inkscape). With the size,
we make sure, that the relative size of components is roughly
(e.g. DIP-8, DIP-16, ...) is the same - otherwise the browser attempts to
scale the images to the maximum available size. Other types of packages might
have different base-sizes, try to set the size so that they look reasonable
as well in browsers.

After saving, mostly it is important to remove the <?xml> header (very first
line) as the go-template thing gets confused otherwise.

Then search for the title and replace it with {{.Value}}. Or add a title
in inkscape with this very string.

These files are very big (the text representation), it might be worthwhile to
explore minimizing these (less burden in the templating engine and on the
wire - and possibly easier to render).
