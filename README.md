Keeping track of stuff
----------------------

Mostly just to organize electronic components at home and at hackerspace.

Nothing to see here yet, work in progress, quick hack.
With a neat useful search though :)

Needs Postgres driver currently

```
go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3
```

maybe switching to SQLite or just plain manual IO as using SQL is kinda lots of
boilerplate overhead.

Beware, I am just playing around with go and a simple http server to learn things.
Also, I don't know any CSS or JavaScript - everything used is just what I think makes
sense.

Provides

- Enter form to enter details found in boxes with a given ID
- Search form with search-as-you-type in an legitimate use of JSON ui :)
